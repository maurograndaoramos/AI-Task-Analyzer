Okay, this is a cool project! 15 hours (5 days x 3 hours) is tight, but doable if I scope it well. I need to be smart about my choices and focus on delivering the core requirements.

Here's my thinking process:

1.  **Understand Constraints & Core Goal:**
    *   **Time:** 15 hours. This is the biggest constraint. KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Student!) is key.
    *   **Core Goal:** Python backend + Crew AI integration. Demonstrate AI agents improving/automating backend operations.
    *   **Technologies:** Python, Crew AI. Choice of Django/FastAPI/CLI. Choice of PostgreSQL/SQLite. Docker.
    *   **Evaluation:** Focus on what gives points: working code, AI integration, DB, docs, tests, deployment.

2.  **Choosing the Backend Framework:**
    *   **Django:** Powerful, but might be too heavy for 15 hours to get everything set up (ORM, admin, etc.) if I'm not super fluent.
    *   **CLI:** Simplest to start, but "RESTful API endpoints" and "user-friendly interfaces (e.g. API documentation)" points towards a web framework. A CLI *could* be a part of the UX, but not the *core* backend service for API requests.
    *   **FastAPI:** Lightweight, modern, built-in data validation with Pydantic (good for "input validation"), automatic OpenAPI/Swagger docs (hits "API documentation" requirement easily). Performance is good, supports async (hits "asynchronous processing" requirement). This seems like the best fit for speed of development and meeting requirements.

    *Decision: FastAPI.*

3.  **Choosing the Database:**
    *   **PostgreSQL:** Robust, scalable, but requires setup, a running service, and potentially more complex configuration.
    *   **SQLite:** File-based, zero-config, perfect for small projects and quick development. "Integrate a reliable database solution" â€“ SQLite is reliable for this scale.

    *Decision: SQLite.* It's simpler and faster to get going.

4.  **Defining the "Useful Task" for AI Agents:**
    This needs to be concrete and demonstrable within the 15-hour limit. "Data analysis, real-time recommendations, or process automation."
    *   Real-time recommendations: Can be complex.
    *   Data analysis: Possible, e.g., analyze some input text.
    *   Process automation: Seems promising.

    *Idea 1: Content Summarizer/Analyzer.*
    *   Endpoint receives text.
    *   AI Agent (Crew AI) summarizes it, extracts keywords, or determines sentiment.
    *   Results are stored and returned.
    *   This is clear, shows AI value, and is relatively easy to implement with Crew AI.

    *Idea 2: Simple Task Management Assistant.*
    *   Endpoint to create a task with a description.
    *   AI Agent analyzes the description, suggests a priority (High, Medium, Low) and maybe a category (e.g., "Bug", "Feature", "Docs").
    *   This directly links to "improve decision making and automate backend operations."

    *Decision: Idea 2 - Task Management Assistant.* It feels more like "automating backend operations" and "improving decision making." The AI agent will help categorize and prioritize tasks.

5.  **Scalability, Performance, Extensibility:**
    *   **Scalability:** FastAPI with Docker allows for horizontal scaling. Design stateless API endpoints. Mention this in docs.
    *   **Performance:** FastAPI is fast. Use async for the Crew AI call if it's a blocking operation (it likely will be).
    *   **Extensibility:** Modular code structure. Separate concerns (API, services, agents).

6.  **Security & Error Handling:**
    *   **Security:** Pydantic for input validation. Basic. Authentication/authorization is "if required." For this task, I'll skip full user auth to save time, but acknowledge it. Maybe a simple API key if there's time, but probably not.
    *   **Error Handling:** Standard try-except blocks, FastAPI exception handlers. Basic logging.

7.  **Testing:**
    *   Pytest.
    *   Unit tests for the service layer (Crew AI interaction).
    *   Integration tests for API endpoints.
    *   "Minimum of 1 meaningful test per feature" - achievable.

8.  **Deployment:**
    *   Dockerfile for the FastAPI app.
    *   `docker-compose.yml` to run the app (and potentially a DB if I chose Postgres, but not needed for SQLite).
    *   CI/CD: GitHub Actions. A simple one: on push to `main`, run linters (e.g., Ruff) and tests.

9.  **Documentation:**
    *   `README.md`: Setup, installation, usage.
    *   FastAPI auto-generated Swagger/OpenAPI docs.
    *   Brief report: Summary, challenges, solutions.
    *   Technical documentation: System architecture (simple diagram), API usage.

10. **Time Allocation (Rough Sketch):**

    *   **Day 1 (3h):**
        *   Project setup (Git, venv, FastAPI boilerplate, basic Dockerfile).
        *   Define Pydantic models (schemas) for Task.
        *   SQLite setup (e.g., with SQLAlchemy Core or just `sqlite3` module initially).
        *   Basic CRUD endpoints for Tasks (Create, Read) *without* AI yet.
    *   **Day 2 (3h):**
        *   Crew AI setup. Define 1 agent (Task Prioritizer/Categorizer).
        *   Create a service layer function to call the Crew AI agent.
        *   Integrate AI into the "Create Task" endpoint (AI populates priority/category).
        *   Test AI integration manually.
    *   **Day 3 (3h):**
        *   Refine AI agent prompt/task if needed.
        *   Write unit tests for the AI service.
        *   Write integration tests for the main API endpoint.
        *   Implement basic error handling and logging.
    *   **Day 4 (3h):**
        *   Finalize Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml`.
        *   Set up basic GitHub Actions (lint, test).
        *   Start writing `README.md` and technical documentation.
        *   Ensure FastAPI docs are good.
    *   **Day 5 (3h):**
        *   Complete all documentation (README, Report).
        *   Code cleanup, comments (PEP8).
        *   Final testing, bug fixes.
        *   Git tag, zip, submit. Buffer for unexpected issues.

This seems like a realistic plan. The key is to keep the AI agent's task simple but demonstrative, and to leverage FastAPI's strengths for quick API development and documentation.

Now, I'll structure this into the `plan.md`.

Okay, generating the `plan.md` now.```markdown
# plan.md - Final Backend Project: AI-Powered Task Assistant

**Student:** [Your Name/ID Here]
**Course:** Backend Programming - 2nd Year
**Project Duration:** 5 days (3 hours/day = 15 hours total)

## 1. Project Objective & Goal Recap

*   **Objective:** Design and develop a Python backend integrating Crew AI for advanced AI agent capabilities, enabling efficient task handling and automation, integrated with a traditional backend framework.
*   **Goal:** Implement an integrated backend system that is robust, performant, extensible, and offers a good user experience (API docs).

## 2. Core Idea & Chosen "Useful Task"

The project will implement an **AI-Powered Task Management Assistant**.
Users can submit new tasks via an API. A Crew AI agent will then analyze the task's description to:
1.  **Categorize** the task (e.g., "Bug Fix", "Feature Request", "Documentation", "Research").
2.  Assign a **Priority** (e.g., "High", "Medium", "Low").

This demonstrates AI improving decision-making (priority setting) and automating backend operations (categorization).

## 3. Technology Stack Choices

*   **Primary Language:** Python
*   **Backend Framework:** **FastAPI**
    *   *Reasoning:* Lightweight, high performance, excellent for building RESTful APIs quickly. Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation meets a key requirement. Pydantic integration aids in data validation and schema definition. Supports asynchronous operations.
*   **AI Agent Framework:** **Crew AI** (as per requirements)
*   **Database:** **SQLite**
    *   *Reasoning:* Simple to set up (file-based), no separate service needed, sufficient for the project's scale and time constraints. Easy to integrate with Python.
*   **Containerization:** **Docker & Docker Compose** (as per requirements)
*   **Testing:** **Pytest**
*   **CI/CD:** **GitHub Actions** (for linting and running tests)
*   **Version Control:** Git (hosted on GitHub/GitLab)

## 6. API Endpoints (Preliminary)

*   `POST /api/v1/tasks/`:
    *   Request Body: `{ "description": "string", "user_story": "optional string", "context": "optional string for more detail" }`
    *   Action: Creates a new task. The backend service will then use the Crew AI agent to analyze the description (and other fields if provided) to determine `category` and `priority`. These are saved with the task.
    *   Response: The created task object including AI-generated fields.
*   `GET /api/v1/tasks/`:
    *   Action: Retrieves a list of all tasks.
    *   Response: Array of task objects.
*   `GET /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}`:
    *   Action: Retrieves a specific task by its ID.
    *   Response: Single task object.

## 7. AI Agent Design (Task Analyzer Agent)

*   **Agent Name:** Task Analyzer Agent
*   **Goal:** To analyze a given task description and intelligently determine its category and priority level.
*   **Backstory:** "You are an expert project management assistant. Your strength lies in quickly understanding the nature of a software development task and assigning it an appropriate category (e.g., Bug Fix, Feature Request, Documentation, Research, Testing) and priority (High, Medium, Low) based on its description, user story, and any provided context. You aim for consistency and clarity."
*   **Tools:** None initially (rely on LLM's built-in capabilities). If time permits and needed, a simple custom tool could be added (e.g., a tool to check against a predefined list of keywords for categories).
*   **Task Definition:**
    1.  Receive task details (description, optional user story, optional context).
    2.  Analyze the input to understand the task's nature.
    3.  Determine the most fitting category from a predefined set: `["Bug Fix", "Feature Request", "Documentation", "Research", "Testing", "Chore"]`.
    4.  Determine the most appropriate priority: `["High", "Medium", "Low"]`.
    5.  Return the category and priority in a structured format (e.g., JSON).

## 8. Database Schema (SQLite)

**Table: `tasks`**
| Column        | Type    | Constraints          | Description                                   |
| :------------ | :------ | :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY AUTOINC. | Unique identifier for the task                |
| `description` | TEXT    | NOT NULL             | User-provided task description                |
| `user_story`  | TEXT    | NULLABLE             | Optional user story for context               |
| `context`     | TEXT    | NULLABLE             | Optional additional context for the task      |
| `category`    | TEXT    | NULLABLE             | AI-generated category (e.g., Bug, Feature)  |
| `priority`    | TEXT    | NULLABLE             | AI-generated priority (e.g., High, Medium)    |
| `status`      | TEXT    | NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Open' | Task status (e.g., Open, In Progress, Done) |
| `created_at`  | TEXT    | NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')) | Timestamp of creation        |
| `updated_at`  | TEXT    | NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')) | Timestamp of last update     |

*(Using TEXT for `created_at` and `updated_at` for simplicity with SQLite, will store ISO8601 strings)*

## 9. Day-by-Day Plan (15 Hours Total)

**Day 1 (3 Hours): Foundation & Basic API**
*   [0.5h] Project setup: Git repo, virtual environment, install FastAPI, Uvicorn, Crew AI (and its dependencies like OpenAI client).
*   [0.5h] Basic FastAPI app (`app/main.py`), simple "Hello World" endpoint.
*   [1h] Define Pydantic schemas (`app/api/v1/schemas.py`) for Task input and output.
*   [1h] SQLite setup (`app/core/db.py`): connection, create `tasks` table (initially without AI fields if easier, can add later). Implement basic CRUD API stubs for tasks (POST/GET) *without* AI integration yet. Store tasks in SQLite.

**Day 2 (3 Hours): Core AI Integration**
*   [1h] Define the `TaskAnalyzerAgent` (`app/agents/task_analyzer_agent.py`) using Crew AI. Test it standalone with a simple script.
*   [1.5h] Create `TaskService` (`app/services/task_service.py`) to encapsulate Crew AI interaction logic. This service will take task details, run the crew, and return category/priority.
*   [0.5h] Integrate `TaskService` into the `POST /api/v1/tasks/` endpoint. Task data should be saved to SQLite *after* AI analysis.

**Day 3 (3 Hours): Testing & Refinement**
*   [1h] Refine agent prompts and task definition for better accuracy. Manually test various inputs.
*   [1h] Write unit tests for `TaskService` using Pytest (mocking Crew AI calls if necessary).
*   [1h] Write integration tests for the `POST /api/v1/tasks/` and `GET /api/v1/tasks/` endpoints.

**Day 4 (3 Hours): Docker, CI & Documentation Start**
*   [1h] Create `Dockerfile` for the FastAPI application.
*   [0.5h] Create `docker-compose.yml` to run the application. Test local Docker deployment.
*   [1h] Set up basic GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) for linting (e.g., Ruff) and running Pytest on push/PR.
*   [0.5h] Start drafting `README.md` (Installation, API Usage) and `REPORT.md` (Project summary).

**Day 5 (3 Hours): Finalization, Documentation & Submission**
*   [1h] Complete `README.md` and `REPORT.md` (Challenges, solutions).
*   [0.5h] Ensure FastAPI's auto-generated Swagger/OpenAPI documentation is clean and usable.
*   [0.5h] Code cleanup: PEP8, inline comments, final review of modularity.
*   [0.5h] Final end-to-end testing. Address any bugs.
*   [0.5h] Create Git tag. Zip the project. Upload to GitHub/GitLab and Google Drive.

## 10. Evaluation Criteria Checklist & Confidence

*   **Source Code (3 points):** Confident. Will ensure clean, modular, documented code with conventional commits.
*   **Backend Application (4 points):** Confident. FastAPI with working Crew AI integration.
*   **AI Agent Integration (3 points):** Confident. One agent performing a useful task (categorization/prioritization) with a clear interface.
*   **Database (2 points):** Confident. SQLite for persistent storage.
*   **Documentation (3 points):** Confident. Technical docs (this plan, architecture in README), user guide (README), API docs (FastAPI auto-docs), brief report.
*   **Testing (2 point):** Confident. Unit and integration tests with Pytest, instructions to run.
*   **Deployment (3 point):** Confident. Docker, Docker Compose, and basic CI/CD script/GitHub Actions.

## 11. Risk Management & Contingency

*   **Risk 1:** Crew AI integration is more complex than anticipated.
    *   **Mitigation:** Simplify the agent's task further. Focus on getting *any* meaningful output first. Rely on basic Crew AI examples.
*   **Risk 2:** Time runs short for all features.
    *   **Mitigation:** Prioritize core functionality: API endpoint -> AI agent -> DB storage -> basic tests -> Docker. Documentation can be polished iteratively. CI/CD can be very basic.
*   **Risk 3:** Unexpected issues with dependencies (e.g., OpenAI API key, Crew AI versioning).
    *   **Mitigation:** Use a `.env` file for API keys from the start. Stick to stable library versions specified in `requirements.txt`. Have a backup plan for a simpler "mock AI" if external APIs are an issue (though Crew AI should work locally with local LLMs if needed, but that's more setup). For this project, assume an OpenAI API key is available and functional.
*   **Risk 4:** Docker/CI setup takes too long.
    *   **Mitigation:** Focus on a working `Dockerfile` first. `docker-compose` is a small step from there. GitHub Actions can be a very simple script.

This plan provides a clear roadmap. The key will be strict time management and focusing on the MVP for each component before adding bells and whistles.
